# Canvas Quiz Student Analysis Reformatting

> - name: canvas-student-analysis-reformatting
> - python>=3.7


## Summary

__Canvas Quiz Student Analysis Reformatting__ is a python script that will reformat any Canvas Quiz Student Analysis export from "wide" to "long" format.  


---

## Inputs

- any csv file in `quiz_student_analysis_file`
  > - note: if there are multiple csvs in this file they will be combined into a single output
  > - see "sample.csv" in the `sample` folder for example (note - you could run this with the sample to see how it works!)

To extract your Student Analysis file from a quiz, in Canvas navigate to the quiz you are interested in, select "Quiz Statistics", and then "Student Analysis". The csv that is generated should then be saved in `quiz_student_analysis_file`

- the input file must include all columns in the original export (green), as well as the questions from that quiz (multi colours)
